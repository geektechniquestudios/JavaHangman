	The current version of this software is 1.0
	The philosophy of the versioning is based around the core functionality being complete,
	and this is a completely functional hangman game. Future updates will be 
	viewed as features, updates, optimizations and bug fixes. 
	
	For reference, the main class is the HangmanStartMenu file
	
	What's to come:
		-Improvements to the graphics and layout, specifically for the 'game over' window, and hangman graphic
		-Sounds to accompany guesses, like a buzzer and a ding
		-improvements to the code, like better compartmentalization and use of GameLogic
		-an options menu using gridbag, OR maybe I'll just learn electron
		-the ability to modify the word bank by way of the options menu using the file object
		-possibly easy/hard mode.
